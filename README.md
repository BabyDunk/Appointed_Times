# Appointed_Times
Auto updating list for Appointed Times of YHWH

This is a small plugin for wordpress to display a list of YHWH Appointed Times. It takes the Hebrew date and converts to the gregorian date, the dates automatically update at the beginning of each gregorian year and store in the database.

This plugin makes use of the Hebcal API, so kind regards to their hard work.
